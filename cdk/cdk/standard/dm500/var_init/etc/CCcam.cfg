#
#STATIC CW FILE : /var/keys/constant.cw


# in this file you can configure what CAIDs CCcam should prefer or ignore
# defaults to /var/etc/CCcam.prio
# file content can have ignores (I) and prio lists (P)
#
# note 1: I line affects both for ecm and emm (receive no emm on ignored systems)
# P line only affects ecm choice (emm still received for all available systems, not just the priority system)
#
# note 2: ident 0 means 'all idents'. So 'caid:0' is the same as 'caid'.
#
# note 3: for some systems (e.g. nagra (caid 18xx)), the ident is not known at the time the
# prio lists are checked. In that case, matching is done on caid only, even if the P line
# defines nonzero idents. So for example '1801:401' behaves the same as '1801' in a P line
# I lines work differently, they are checked two times, once before ecm or emm is received, again
# after ecm or emm are received (and nagra ident should be known)
# P lines are only checked once, before ecm received.
#
# note 4: if a P line contains caid:ident pairs which are not available for the current
# channel, that P line is not used for that channel.
# Example, channel has systems 626, 1801:401 then P line with "1801,100:96,626" is ignored by that channel,
# because channel doesn't have 100:96.
# But P line with "1801" works, and also "626,1801" will work for channel
#
# note 5: P lines are parsed in the order in which they are found in the prio file.
# Only the first matching P line is used
#
# situation 1: ignore allways this caid, all idents, on all channels
# I: caid
#
# situation 2: ignore allways this caid/ident pair
# I: caid:ident
#
# situation 3: ignore this caid/ident pair, on channel 'sid'
# I: caid:ident:sid
#
# situation 4: when both caid1 and caid2 exist for a channel, prefer caid1 over caid2
# P: caid1, caid2
#
# situation 5: when caid1:ident1 till caidN:identN exist for a channel, use them in order of this list.
# P: caid1:ident1, caid2:ident2, .., caidN:identN
#
# situation 6: when caid1:ident1 till caidN:identN exist for channel 'sid', use them in order of this list.
# Sid on first caid/ident pair identifies sid for which list is used. All other sids ignore this list.

# Irdeto smartcards: option to disable smart chid checking for irdeto smartcards.
# Default, only chids advertised by card are accepted.
# This avoids a lot of unwanted card traffic
#
# But if smartcard has hidden/unknown chids, all chids should be tried.
# In that case specify 'TRY ALL CHIDS' option for cardreader.
# Use with care, enabling option causes more card traffic.
# Only use setting when some channels don't work without it.
# note: if even this setting don't help decode all channels, try using
# commandline arg -l, to disable all self-learning features (warning: slower)
#
#TRY ALL CHIDS : <device>

#example: card in /dev/ttyUSB0 gets ecm for all possible chids, not
