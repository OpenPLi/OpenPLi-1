B3.5.0
- alias management reviewed
   - an input can be aliased with 2 or more channels.
   - names are compared in uppercase.
   - channels ending with "+1" : search for input with same name without "+1", and a timeshift of 1 hour is applied.
- IMDB : try to search IMDB even if the film flag is not set.
- otvepg more fast and more complete.
- italian language, thanks to terminet !
B3.4.1

- verify minus in inputs.txt before try to load epg data
B3.4
- updated mhwepg to 0.4.3 version
- updated otvepg to new version

B3.1

Feature Changes

- removed the installer, can't be bothered to maintain it
- removed mhwepg from distribution. You can find it at
  http://www.tech-sources.com/~download/pli/mv/mhwepg
- fixed double keypress needed in list views often. Can't
  remember why I put that in, hope it doesn't break anything
- amended default input time offsets, fixed code so next
  DST should be handled OK in Western Europe. Other folks
  may need to manually adjust /var/tuxbox/config/inputs.txt.
- catch genres describing films for MHW(ES) and MHW(IT),
  [thanks m0bil2 and oskardto on satindustry board]
- changed stray key catching so that in 1.08.2+ images
  when MV is started from the red button it doesn't need
  an extra keypress. There's a 50ms startup delay, probably
  most people won't notice :-)
- list view channel and program title/time font sizes
  now configurable
- if postdownload.sh is in /var/tuxbox/config/mv, it
  will be called after every download with the path of
  the downloaded file
- if postmhw.sh is in /var/tuxbox/config/mv, it
  will be called after every download with the path of
  the file containing MHW data
  [requested Tom0000]
- spanish tranlation file added
  [thanks to Carles Sanchez]
- german translation file added
  [thanks to Dre + GabKnight]
- icon additions/changes
  [thanks to:  
   Scandanavian: Scorcher@ sat-industry
   Spanish: Cierzo via IGM3 @ sat-industry
   German: Trial/deltagolf @ DBF, Kat-CeDe @ DMM board
  ]
- changed XML parsing: encoding specified in input.txt is
  given to the parser, no explicit encoding conversion is
  done. Can't get Wolf's German umlaut correct though :-(
- changed description of Ultimatetvguide to NordicTEAM:
  in default inputs.txt: URL has changed.
  Delete old /var/tuxbox/config/mv/inputs.txt to see change.
- reset log on startup, not shutdown
- included script scripts/mvdatadir, which echos to stdout
  the data dir configured in /var/tuxbox/config/mv/conf.bin
- added scripts/goepg. This is intended to be run by cron,
  it can automatically refresh the MHW data used by MV
  e.g. while you sleep :-)
  [Original from PLi, rewritten by tCC, modified by Pent Vaer]
- took out grab scripts

Bug Fixes

- stopped double channel refresh when returning from info
  window (nasty flicker gone)
- store/restore icons correctly when showing info window
- finally fixed bug where moving cursor around causes
  program right boundary to shift right
- indicators were getting wiped when hiding main window
- stop catching stray keys on startup for enigma 
  versions > 1081, we assume that MV is used from red
  button, and that doesn't seem to generate stray keys
  on plugin startup
- local xmltv files were not being converted if there were
  no download inputs
  [reported 3d_jc, DMM board]
- could not move cursor left/right on view 2

B3.0

Major Feature Changes

- support for IMDB queries developed in cooperation
  with Bjorn Hijmans (network required)
- new version of mhwepg supporting Sky EPG
  Many thanks to PLi for that!
- added bouquet selector (AUDIO)
- big list view presentation improvements
- dramatically decreased file size and load times for XMLTV by
  converting to EPGUI format immediately following download,
  This is at cost of a (once per file) few seconds conversion time
  (the conversion is done in the background, the plugin is
  still usable while it's going on)
  NOTE: if an XMLTV file is enormous (MBs), the DB will probably
  run out of memory loading the file into memory in order
  to convert it anyway. 
- added channel icons 
  See http://mv.dinglisch.net/userguide.html#icons for info.
  Thanks to Bjorn Hijmans on the sat4all board for help with png
  handling.

Other Feature Changes

- added colour for programs that are currently playing 
  on current (configurable) and other (lighter than
  configurable colour) in list views (presentation
  menu)
- added (configurable) coloured bars for films and favourites
  in list views
- changed format feature editor (split into sections),
  (design and coding by Alex Shtol)
- added title centering in program box (option, feature menu,
  graphical views only)
- added iconmap and icons dir to install.sh
- added option enable/disable channel name/icon in list view
- < and > on a list view will switch to the channel list
  for the next channel (where 'current channel' is the
  cursor channel or playing channel)
- only load all programs for current channel on list view
  if there's a cache input enabled
- don't indicate cache update if it comes within first 2 seconds
  after changing a channel. That's usually not because new
  data has come in.
- added optional auto-reload when enigma cache reports new data.
  Configure in input menu. 
  Auto-reload only takes place if the current view is a graphical
  view at the time it's needed.
  I deliberately did not enable auto-reload for download/MHW
  completion for reasons outlined in the userguide.
- added auto-configure option for MV data directories. If
  enabled, MV will set it's data dirs dependent on the
  available storage media everytime it starts up.
  I recommend *disabling* this once you know what you're doing,
  it's for novice users to not have to worry about where stuff
  is configured, and for image makers to be able to distribute
  a customized version of MV more easily.
- moved timer list to SHIFT-RED
- added TV1000-1, TV1000-3, Cinema-1, Cinema-3 to dtgrab.pl
- increased default 'days ahead' for downloads

  for some users otherwise)
- can press INFO when window hidden to get current playing 
  program description
- changed list view title to extend when channel name and/or
  icon are not being displayed, also channel name/icon are
  no longer shifted right when a timer icon is being displayed

   (and channels using <, >) improved
- added sort option for list views (see Feature Menu).
  1. By bouquet channel then start time, includes special
     formatting
  2. By start time only
- treat Cinema 1-3 as film channel for marking purposes
- more OOM checking on channel/program creation (untested)
- added possibility to configure items/channel on list views.
  Probably only really useful for view 9
- moved system time error message into lang.txt.en, missed it
  last time
- started logging some stuff to /var/tmp/mv.log
- added vertical separators as default to view 1
- started logging mhwepg bad exit code in text log
  instead of on screen,
  since it always gave -1 on my mixed 1.08/1.07
  environment
- added simple checksum for config, so that corrupted configs
  shouldn't cause box to crash on startup (request of Alex Shtol)
- changed default input defs Wolf encoding to UTF
- don't check downloads/MHW on reload (with 0)
- added option disable channel name inchannel header
- rearranged main menu items, added another sep

  window title.
- added a russian language source for sirius/hotbird, though
  I can't verify if it works well. Thanks again to Alex
  Shtol.

  PC easier. Added warning in input menu that no data is
  associated unless user does it themselves :-)

  the future

  beschikbaar' from cache as short description)
- changed user agent for downloads to match new name
- switched to eMessageBox for flashup messages

Bug Fixes

- fixed occasional multiple-reloads when reloading 	
  (by pressing 0) in list window
- fixed flashing error window to always fit the text
- fixed small on-exit memory leak from Channel cleanup
  if a reload had occured during running (would have
  gotten big when using new bouquet select feature!)
- added few simple checks restrain threads from interfering
  with each other, maybe stops the scan crashes
- increased window and font size of popup description
  window
- time and L indicators were not coming up on startup
- L and S indicators were not coming up on cache save
- 'between' was listed twice in favourite edit time selector
  (thanks Tom0000)
- fixed crashes exiting while MHW scan in progress
- code to tidy up old downloads was not being called
- fixed (rarely occuring) memory leak if error in XMLTV format
- bug saving enigma cache, time offset was being applied
  incorrectly
- if error on startup an uninitialised config was sometimes
  being written
- stop including short descriptions which are duplicates of
  the title in some cases

  moves to a program at the border.

  on data reload
- 99.5% of texts -> lang.txt.en
